# âš¡ Modern Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop Designs (VLSI/CMOS)

In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration), the term "master-slave" is frequently used interchangeably with, or as the conceptual basis for, modern edge-triggered flip-flops. A common and highly optimized VLSI flip-flop is actually a variant of the master-slave concept, often implemented using **Transmission Gates (CMOS switches)** rather than just standard NAND/NOR logic gates.

This document explores the two most common modern flip-flop architectures used in high-performance CMOS designs.

## I. Transmission-Gate Based Design (Master-Slave Variant)

This design uses two latches and pairs of MOS switches called **Transmission Gates (TG)** to achieve a robust edge-triggered behavior.

### 1. Structure and Operation

The TG-based D flip-flop is a cascade of two D-latches: a Master Latch (first stage) and a Slave Latch (second stage).

* **When CLK = 1:** The first Transmission Gate (TG1) is ON, and the Master Latch (Latch1) samples the input **D**. TG2 is OFF, meaning the Slave Latch (Latch2) holds its previous state.
* **When CLK transitions $1 \to 0$ (The Edge):**
    * The Transmission Gate at the master's input turns OFF (isolating $\mathbf{Q_M}$ from $\mathbf{D}$).
    * The slave latch's input TG turns ON (because the slave is clocked by $\overline{\text{CLK}}$, which transitions $0 \to 1$), and the data $\mathbf{Q_M}$ is transferred to the final output **Q**.

This design successfully **removes transparent time overlap** and ensures **no race-around** condition, making it highly stable.

### 2. How Edge-Triggering is Achieved

The system relies on the clock ($\text{CLK}$) and its inverse ($\overline{\text{CLK}}$) to create a **break-before-make** action. The master latch tracks the input **D** only when $\text{CLK}=1$ (the "Setup" Window), but the final output **Q** only updates when the clock transitions. The master latch is tracking the input **D** when $\mathbf{CLK=1}$, and simultaneously, the slave latch is also OFF (holds its state).

## II. Pulse-Triggered Flip-Flops (Modern High-Speed Designs)

Pulse-triggered flip-flops are used in modern high-performance designs (CPUs, ASICs, mobile SoCs). The key idea is to use only **one latch** and open it for a **tiny pulse** only at the clock edge, which eliminates transparency and race issues.

### 1. Structure and Operation



The design uses a clock pulse generator to replace the traditional two-phase clocking of the master-slave concept.

1.  **Clock Edge $\to$ Pulse:** A dedicated **Pulse Generator** (often using a delay element and an AND/XOR gate) creates a **very short, narrow pulse** upon the rising or falling clock edge.
2.  **During Pulse:** While the pulse is active, the latch is open (captures D). Transistors P1 + N1 form a transmission gate controlled by the pulse: Pulse = 1 $\to$ P1 and N1 ON $\to$ D passes to node X.
3.  **After Pulse:** The pulse ends (Pulse = 0), the transmission gate turns OFF, isolating the node **X** from **D**.
4.  **Storage:** A pair of inverters connected around the internal node **X** act as a storage latch, holding the captured value. If X was set to 1 $\to$ feedback keeps it 1. The flip-flop updates **Q** only during that tiny pulse window. On the next rising edge $\to$ a new short pulse briefly reopens the transmission gate $\to$ new D is captured $\to$ flip-flop updates Q.

### 2. Advantages

Pulse-triggered flip-flops offer **very high performance** and **low power**. They use **only one latch**, resulting in **fewer transistors** and making them faster than the master-slave concept.

## III. Reasons for Moving Away from Simple Gate Designs

VLSI designers move away from simple flip-flops built purely from static NAND/NOR logic gates (e.g., using 6 NAND gates) for three main reasons:

1.  **High Transistor Count & Area (Complexity):** The structure using 6 NAND gates for the core logic results in a minimum of **24 transistors** (4 transistors per CMOS NAND gate). Highly optimized, industry-standard flip-flops (like TG-based or CÂ²MOS) can achieve edge-triggered behavior with **significantly fewer transistors** (e.g., as few as 16-20 transistors) to save die area and reduce costs.
2.  **Power Consumption (High Switching Activity):** Flip-flops built purely from static NAND/NOR gates consume more **dynamic power** because every gate switches whenever the clock and data change. Modern transistor-level designs (especially those using dynamic or semi-dynamic logic) minimize redundant switching on internal nodes, leading to much **lower power consumption**.
3.  **Timing and Clock Complexity (Delay/Skew):** The NAND-gate edge-triggered flip-flop requires the inverted clock signal ($\overline{\text{CLK}}$) to be generated internally (or externally). Generating a sharp, precise, and symmetrical $\overline{\text{CLK}}$ signal adds complexity, consumes power, and is a source of **clock skew** (timing difference between $\text{CLK}$ and $\overline{\text{CLK}}$), which degrades performance.

| **Race Condition** | No | Needs careful pulse width |
