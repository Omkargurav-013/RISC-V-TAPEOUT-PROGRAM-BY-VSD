# RISC-V-TAPEOUT-PROGRAM-BY-VSD

## üôè Acknowledgments

*This course is part of a free initiative jointly offered by the **VLSI System Design (VSD)** platform and **IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN)**. I am thankful to Kunal Ghosh and the Team VSD for their vision and constant support in creating this unique learning ecosystem, and to IIT Gandhinagar for their academic collaboration. The RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program provides an invaluable opportunity to explore the complete VLSI design flow, from RTL to GDSII, and I look forward to progressing through each week of this journey.*
