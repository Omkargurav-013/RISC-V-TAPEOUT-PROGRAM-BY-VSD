# üë∂ VSDBabySoC: A RISC-V Mixed-Signal Chip (Sky130)

The **VSDBabySoC** is a small, yet powerful, open-source **RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC)**, fabricated using **Sky130 technology**. It is designed primarily for testing, integrating open-source Intellectual Property (IP) cores, and calibrating the analog part of the design.

As a **mixed-signal chip**, it seamlessly integrates digital computation with analog signal generation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Components and Working Principle

The core functionality of the VSDBabySoC revolves around the interaction of three main IP cores: one digital and two analog/mixed-signal.

### 1. RVMYTH Microprocessor (Digital Core)

The RVMYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) is the central digital brain, built on the open-source **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Simple, teaching-focused CPU implementing the **RV32I subset** (base 32-bit integer instructions) of the RISC-V ISA. |
| **Origin** | Developed for the **MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) workshop** to enable students to rapidly design a processor. |
| **Design Language** | Typically designed using **TL-Verilog** (Transaction-Level Verilog), which simplifies modeling and implementation. |
| **Role in SoC** | Fetches instructions from its instruction memory (imem) and executes them. Performs computations and writes the resulting **digital data** to a designated register (e.g., **r17**). |

### 2. Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) (Analog/Mixed-Signal Core)

The 8x-PLL acts as the system's clock generator and controller.

* **Function:** It takes an initial, external, lower-frequency input signal (reference clock) and generates a stable, **higher-frequency internal clock (CLK)** for the entire chip.
* **Role:** This **CLK** signal synchronizes the operation of the digital logic, ensuring the RVMYTH core executes instructions correctly and sequentially.

### 3. Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) (Analog Core)

The 10-bit DAC serves as the system's way to communicate its output to the outside world, effectively bridging the digital and analog domains.

* **Function:** It takes the **digital values** generated by the RVMYTH processor (e.g., the values stored in register **r17**) and converts them into a continuous **analog output signal (OUT)**.
* **Role:** This analog signal can be used by external devices, though its primary purpose in this design is educational and testing.

## üîÑ Summary of Operation

The VSDBabySoC operates by creating a closed loop between clock, computation, and output:

1.  **Clock Start:** The PLL starts up and generates a stable **CLK**.
2.  **Execution:** The **RVMYTH processor** uses this CLK to execute the program instructions stored in its memory.
3.  **Data Output:** The executed instructions cause the processor to compute and store digital output values in a specific register.
4.  **Signal Generation:** The **DAC** reads these digital values and converts them into the final analog signal (**OUT**).

### RVMYTH Pipelining Concepts

A basic implementation of a RISC-V CPU like RVMYTH follows the standard stages of a processor pipeline:

| Stage | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fetch (IF)** | Reads the instruction from memory pointed to by the Program Counter (PC). |
| **Decode (ID)** | Decodes the instruction; reads data from the Register File (32 GPRs). |
| **Execute (EX)** | Performs the operation using the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). |
| **Memory (MEM)** | Performs load or store operations to data memory (if needed). |
| **Write Back (WB)** | Writes the result back to a register in the Register File. |

The VSDBabySoC is a fully open-source project, making it an extremely valuable educational tool for learning about full-custom SoC design and the integration of diverse IP cores.

## üöÄ RVMYTH Processor: A RISC-V Core for Education and Testing

The **RVMYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours)** is a simple, open-source **RISC-V-based CPU core** that serves a crucial educational and testing role, particularly within the VSDBabySoC project.


## üî¨ Core Architecture and Origin

The RVMYTH core is a teaching-focused processor, designed to simplify the design process for educational purposes:

* **RISC-V Base:** It implements the **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**, which is an open-source, free, and extensible ISA. This choice reflects the open-source nature of the entire VSDBabySoC project.
* **Educational Purpose:** The core was developed as part of the **MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) workshop** organized by RedwoodEDA and VSD. The goal was to enable students to design and create a processor from scratch in a very short amount of time.
* **TL-Verilog Implementation:** RVMYTH is typically designed and modeled using **TL-Verilog (Transaction-Level Verilog)**, which is a hardware description language that simplifies the process of creating complex digital designs, especially for pipelined architectures. This acceleration in design is what makes the 30-hour workshop feasible.
* **RV32I Subset:** RVMYTH generally implements the **RV32I subset** of the RISC-V ISA, which is the base integer instruction set for a 32-bit processor. This includes fundamental operations like arithmetic, memory access, and control flow.

## üéØ Role in the VSDBabySoC

In the context of the VSDBabySoC, the RVMYTH processor is the central digital brain. Its function involves three main steps:

1.  **Instruction Fetch and Execution:** It fetches instructions from its memory (**I-Mem**) and executes them cycle by cycle, controlled by the stable clock generated by the on-chip PLL.
2.  **Data Generation:** The program running on the RVMYTH is designed to generate a sequence of digital values. For example, the program might compute a series of numbers and store the final or intermediate results in one of its 32 internal registers (e.g., register **r17**).
3.  **Digital Output to DAC:** The digital values produced by the RVMYTH core are fed directly to the on-chip 10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). This is the key interface: the RVMYTH creates the data, and the DAC converts that data into the analog output signal for the rest of the world.

In essence, the RVMYTH provides the digital content for the mixed-signal chip, enabling the entire system to perform a function and generate an observable analog signal.

## üß± Key Architectural Concepts (Pipelining)

A basic implementation of a RISC-V CPU like RVMYTH will involve the standard stages of a processor pipeline:

| Stage | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fetch (IF)** | Reads the instruction from memory pointed to by the Program Counter (PC). |
| **Decode (ID)** | Decodes the instruction to determine the operation, reads the necessary data from the Register File (32 general-purpose registers). |
| **Execute (EX)** | Performs the operation using the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). |
| **Memory (MEM)** | Performs load or store operations to data memory (if needed). |
| **Write Back (WB)** | Writes the result of the operation back to a register in the Register File.

The RVMYTH core demonstrates how these digital logic blocks are implemented and integrated to create a functioning computer on a chip.
